## **Overview**<br>
This repository contains code associated with "Functional analysis of O-GlcNAcylation by networking of OGT interactors and substrates" by Griffin ME, Thompson JW, et al.

It includes our novel algorithms for parsimonious enumeration of PTMs in mass spectrometry data (see Extended Data Figure 2. Main Text, and Methods):<br>
SiteAndRegions.py<br>
SitesAndRegionsMultiExperiment.py (includes the additional option to separate conditions/replicates)<br>

It also includes Jupyter Notebooks:<br>
Adaptor Protein Ranking.ipynb (used to rank potential hub proteins)<br>
Network Generation.ipynb (used to make OGT substrate and interactor networks) <br>
Sites and Regions Analysis.ipynb (used to quantify and localize O-GlcNAc sites with the algorithm above)<br>S

## **System Requirements**<br>
All code has been test
